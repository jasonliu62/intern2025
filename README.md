# Microsoft 8-K Filing State Update Tool

## ðŸ“˜ Background Story

Microsoft Corporation recently moved its official incorporation from **Washington** to **Delaware** to streamline legal operations. As part of regulatory compliance, this change must be reflected in its **8-K SEC filing**, specifically in the XBRL-tagged `<dei:EntityIncorporationStateCountryCode>` field.

You've been brought in as a software intern to help automate this update using Python. Your mission is to ensure the new state is correctly embedded in the 8-K HTML document and assist in maintaining the integrity of the filing.
